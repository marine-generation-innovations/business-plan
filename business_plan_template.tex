\section{Executive Summary}

Marine Generation Innovations is a high tech startup in the renewable energy sector with a winning team of five partners: Robert Brown, our Chief Financial Officer, is a certified public accountant and certified engineer; Jan Krawczyk, our Chief Executive Officer, has experience in the marine energy generation industry, and holds a Masters of Engineering with Renewable Energy; Blake Hawkins, our Chairman, has experience with a successful high tech startup together with Fearghal Mac Giolla Easpaig, our Chief Technical Officer - the two also hold an MBA from Harvard, and an MEng in Electrical Engineering, respectively; Dimitar Tashkov, our Chief Operating Officer, is a chartered process engineering with significant experience in industry. Together we have the skill set necessary to start a business in this rapidly changing industry.\\

Our initial product will be a pair of permanent magnet generators for use in submerged, flooded energy generation, especially useful in deep sea. Similar, sealed products exist, but their design is stagnant. MGI products will be cheaper to maintain and provide more efficient energy generation, and will continue to improve over the years. Our initial customers will be the owners of existing deep sea generators, who are looking for improved product to reduce maintenance costs. As the industry advances, further innovation will provide a more enticing price margin, and we expect new customers to react enthusiastically.\\

We are looking for an investment of Â£750,000 which will fund procurement, employees, our first prototype, and indeed even our first production installation. We also foresee a minimum growth of 200 percent in five years.
